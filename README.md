# [Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/aws/) API

This is the api for portfolio website created using react app as part of the cloud resume challenge by [Forrest Brazeal](https://forrestbrazeal.com/). This API is used for storing and retrieving total number of page visits for [vishnuverse.xyz](https://vishnuverse.xyz/)

By the end of this challenge I will have my portfolio website built and deployed using the AWS ecosystem.

The API consist of two lambda functions:
